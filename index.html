  <div class ="user-post">Impressive! Though it seems the drag feature could be improved. But overall it looks incredible. You've nailed the design and the responsiveness at various breakpoints works really well.</div>

  <div class ="user-post">Woah, your project looks awesome! How long have you been coding for? I'm still new, but think I want to dive into React as well soon. Perhaps you can give me an insight on where I can learn React? Thanks!</div>

  <div class ="user-post">@maxblagun If you're still new, I'd recommend focusing on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS before considering React. It's very tempting to jump ahead but lay a solid foundation first.</div>

  <!-- clarify if in there needs to be a class for replies and if there needs to be the user-name class within the replies-->
  <div class ="user-post">@ramsesmiron I couldn't agree more with this. Everything moves so fast and it always seems like everyone knows the newest library/framework. But the fundamentals are what stay constant.</div>
